The Car Rental Management System is designed to simplify the car rental process, providing a user-friendly platform for customers to register, log in, and book vehicles for various rental durations. 
With secure handling of customer information, including driving license and Aadhar card verification, the system ensures that only verified users can proceed with bookings.
The admin module enables effective management of bookings and customer data, reinforcing the system's reliability and security. 
This project serves as a solid foundation for further enhancements, including features like real-time car availability tracking and expanded reporting capabilities.
